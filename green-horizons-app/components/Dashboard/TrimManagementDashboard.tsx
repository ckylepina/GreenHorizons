      <p>Here, you&apos;ll eventually be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>View a list of Trim team employees with their clock-in, clock-out, and lunch times.</li>
        <li>See calculated total work hours for the day.</li>
        <li>Input trimming data for each employee (grams weighed, pounds calculated, and associated strain).</li>
        <li>Review daily and aggregated totals for trimming across the harvest.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is just a basic layout to get started. More detailed features and interactivity can be added later.</p>
